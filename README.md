# Solidity By Examples

This project is a practicing place, for learning solidity as a programming language and development of smart contracts, starting with all the code examples provided in [solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/). Each module has its own branch with naming convention as `<number in incremental order>.<module name>`, for example, the branch for each module available on [solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/), will be as follows:

1. SolidityCore
2. Applications
3. Hacks
4. Tests
5. DeFi

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
